# Cook App

## About the Project

Have you ever come home hungry after a long day of work only to realize you forgot to stop by the market for groceries? You open the fridge to make dinner with whatever ingredients you have, but lack the creativity to come up with a meal. The Cook App is here to solve that problem! In this React Native hands-on event class, we'll create an application that suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have at home using React Native, Expo, Expo Router, Supabase, and React Native Reanimated.

## Technologies Used
